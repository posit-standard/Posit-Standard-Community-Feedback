# Posit-Standard-Community-Feedback

The Posit standard was rectified and published at Supercomputing Asia 2022.
This moves the standard into a new phase of discovery as the community
of stakeholders broadens, and the standard is subjected to new empirical
tests.

This github repository provides the community a central place to collect, 
discuss, and manage questions, issues, and feedback.
We'll use the standard gitflow workflow to collect and discuss matters.
File issues to log your feedback, and if the topic merits a deep dive
we'll create a topic branch to manage the assets for the deep dive.
Once resolved, we'll merge that branch into the main line so that it
is part of our history.
